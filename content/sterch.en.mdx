# Sterch

When it comes to labeling technology and shipping materials, the guys at Sterch know their stuff. While offline sales were growing, the web store was a constant source of concern: lack of availability, costly maintenance and no contemporary design.
Together with Eisberg, both the web store and the company's online presence were completely overhauled. Thanks to state-of-the-art technology and contemporary design, online sales can now also increase.

## Headless eCommerce

Until now, Sterch relied on a **Magento 2** store system. The maintenance of such outdated store systems is **time-consuming** or **cost-intensive**. Ensuring availability and individualization requests cost a lot of time and nerves.

With us, Sterch has switched to a contemporary concept called **Headless eCommerce**. The store system is completely detached from the actual shopping experience of the customer. So now [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/) provides Sterch with all the capabilities to conduct their online business, while we have created a highly customized storefront.

- **High availability** of the entire store system (SLA bound > 99.9%)
- Individualization in the presentation layer in any form easily possible
- Customization or conversion of the store system (backend) is possible

## State of the Art Performance and Accessibility

The [Google Lighthouse Score](https://youtu.be/mLjxXPHuIJo) is an established means of evaluating a website according to the following criteria: performance (loading speed), accessibility, best practices, SEO, (progressive web app).

We deliver only the latest technology and understand our craft. That's why both Sterch's website and web store achieve a **flawless Rating**. In comparison, we show the score of the old Sterch webshop and a current score of a competitor.

- **Website Performance** that does not let the Converstion rate drop.
- Usability on any device, whether desktop PC or smartphone.
- SEO configuration to get optimal results in **Google rankings**.

Here is a comparison of the old Sterch webshop, the new one and a current competitor.
